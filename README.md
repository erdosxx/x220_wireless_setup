# XYKBMS: ThinkPad X220 Wireless Keyboard Setup
This program is designed to configure the wireless keyboard modification for the ThinkPad X220.
You can purchase the keyboard from [Superbuy](https://www.superbuy.com/en/page/buy/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fitem.taobao.com%2Fitem.htm%3Fid%3D615425421671&htag=pc.en.shop.64923774&nTag=pc.en.shop.64923774).

## Setup Instructions
The configuration utility, `XYKBMS_SWUpdate.exe`, is compatible with Windows operating systems.
The default configuration file is `xykbms_pin_default_utf8.cfg`.
This also convered version of encoding from `gbk` to `utf8`.
## Language Support
As the original documentation and configuration files are in Chinese,
they may be difficult to understand for non-Chinese speakers. To address this issue:
`manual.pdf` and `xykbms_pin_default_uk_jp_utf8.cfg` now include Korean translations.

## Keyboard Layout Support
The original configuration file only supports the US keyboard layout.
To accommodate Japanese and European users, an additional configuration file has been created:
`xykbms_pin_default_uk_jp_utf8.cfg`: This file supports both European and Japanese layouts for the ThinkPad X220 keyboard.
By using these resources, users can more easily set up and customize their
ThinkPad X220 wireless keyboard modification, regardless of their preferred language or keyboard layout.
